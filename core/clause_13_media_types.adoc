== Media Types

NOTE: Implementations should use `application/vnd.ogc.fg+json` as a preliminary media type until this Standard is stable to avoid confusing future implementations accessing JSON documents from draft versions of this Standard. The media type `application/fg+json` will be registered for JSON-FG, if and once this Standard is approved by the OGC Members. This note will be removed before publishing the JSON-FG Standard.

Since a JSON-FG document also conforms to GeoJSON, both the GeoJSON and the JSON-FG media types can be used. APIs that provide feature data that conforms to both GeoJSON and JSON-FG should declare support for both media types in the API definition to support clients that know JSON-FG as well as those that only support GeoJSON.

[[application_fg_json]]
=== application/fg+json

----
Type name: application

Subtype name: fg+json

Required parameters: n/a

Optional parameters:

  "compatibility": If provided, the value "geojson" indicates that JSON-FG features 
  with a "place" member that is not 'null' will also include a GeoJSON geometry 
  in the "geometry" member (a point, line string, polygon or an aggregation of them 
  in WGS 84). If the parameter is missing, the "geometry" member of a JSON-FG feature 
  will be 'null', if the "place" member is not 'null'. For any other parameter value, 
  the behavior is unspecified.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: The security considerations for GeoJSON as specified in Section 10 of IETF RFC 7946 also apply to JSON-FG.

Interoperability considerations: The interoperability considerations for GeoJSON as specified in Section 11 of IETF RFC 7946 also apply to JSON-FG. 

Published specification: this document

Applications that use this media type: No known applications currently use this media type. 
   This media type is intended for applications currently using the "application/vnd.ogc.fg+json" 
   media type, which include APIs for managing, publishing or processing geospatial data, 
   tools for processing geospatial data, web mapping applications, etc.

Intended usage: COMMON

  GeoJSON (IETF RFC 7946) is a popular encoding for geospatial data. GeoJSON is widely supported. 
  However, GeoJSON has intentional restrictions that prevent or limit its use in certain geospatial 
  application contexts. For example, GeoJSON is restricted to WGS 84 coordinates, does not 
  support volumetric geometries and has no concept of classifying features according to their type.
  JSON-FG (OGC Features and Geometries JSON) specifies a set of GeoJSON extensions that provide 
  standard ways to support such requirements. 

Restrictions on usage: n/a
